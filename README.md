### What I learned

I learned to handle form with JS, also learned to write BEM syntax CSS.

### Continued development

There are still many rooms for improvement: padding for tablet view, I struggled with adding animation for switching between the email form and the success message, it made me rethink about how I styled them.

### Useful resources

- [BEM CSS](https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) - This helped me understand my own CSS.
- [How to Build and Validate Beautiful Forms with Vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-and-validate-beautiful-forms-with-vanilla-html-css-js/) - Helped me with form validation.
